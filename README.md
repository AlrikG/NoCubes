# NoCubes mod
A mod for 1.12.2 that creates a cosmetic-only curved terrain layout in Minecraft. Original mod by Click_Me, Reverse Engineered under his permission (and modified with removed Mojang code where possible) by CosmicDan & updated to 1.12.2 by Cadiboo (me). I have also refactored and added comments to the code. These comments were taken from a JavaScript implementation of Surface Nets (The algorithm that NoCubes uses) that I found linked on the Source Theory website.

###### This mod depends on [RenderChunk rebuildChunk Hooks](https://github.com/Cadiboo/RenderChunk-rebuildChunk-Hooks), A coremod that I (Cadiboo) slapped together for Compatability/Staying with Forge standards/Utility. Here be dragons - You have been warned.
###### To work on the code you have to manually add the coremod (from ./libs/RenderChunk rebuildChunk Hooks) to the build path, sorry I don't know how to automate this without making a proper maven repository which I'm too lazy to do
